# Analyzeer

A while back Deezer sent me an email with statistics on what I listened to for the last month. As someone who discovers and listens to hours of music a week, I thought it was really cool to see. Sadly, I didn't receive another mail like this the following month, nor the month after that, so I decided to implement something myself using Deezer's API. Analyzeer was born.
